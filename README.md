This is a small project done by my team. The project uses the yolo algorithm to classify traffic signs.

Yolo is a CNN model for object detection, recognition, and classification. Yolo is created by combining convolutional layers and connected layers. In which convolutional layers will extract the features of the image, and fully-connected layers will predict the probability and coordinates of the object.
The core library of the project is the Ultralytics library. Ultralytics is the company that develops and maintains modern versions of the YOLO model, including the latest versions such as YOLOv5 and YOLOv8.

The Ultralytics library was created to provide a simple and efficient interface for using YOLO models in machine learning and computer vision projects.
The last thing to note is the Roboflow environment. Roboflow is a platform that provides tools and services for managing, preparing, and training machine learning models, with a particular focus on computer vision. Roboflow helps developers and researchers handle tasks related to image data more easily and efficiently.
